## Usage

Continue reading for information on usage of the SDK.

### With Dependency Injection

The easiest way to use the library is by using dependency injection.
In the following sections you can see the easiest ways to use the library.

#### Dependency Injection: .NET Core Web Application

* Register the WaybackMachineCsharpSdk interface in the startup file
* Inject the service in the class where you want to use it

#### Dependency Injection: Azure Function

The pattern for using dependency injection in an Azure Function is similar to a web application.

* Create a startup.cs file to enable dependency injection
* Register the WaybackMachineCsharpSdk interface in the startup file
* Inject the service in the class where you want to use it

## Developing

The project is bootstrapped with [create-react-library](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library) and TypeScript has been added to the project. You can read more about the development workflow in the [project docs](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library).

To start developing, you need to open two terminals.

In the first tab, run from the main directory:
```
npm start
```
This will activate rollup to watch for any changes to your src directory and build the dist everytime.

In another terminal, navigate to the example folder:
```
cd example
```
Then run:
```
npm install
```
and finally:
```
npm start
```

This will start up the development server allowing you to see the results.
